# Pihole

Pihole is an ad-blocker that works by blocking advertisement-related DNS queries directly. That means that contrary to browser ad-blockers, your device **never actually receives any data from advertisement providers**, freeing your internet bandwidth.

Any device connected to your router get ad-blocking for free !

## Setting up pihole

To be honest, this is the black magic part.

Since the whole point of this repository is to direct services through a single point of entry, we need to assign a separate IP address to the container that will be used as a DNS server on the network. It turns out Docker provides a `macvlan` driver, which "assign a MAC address to each containerâ€™s virtual network interface, making it appear to be a physical network interface directly connected to the physical network" (from the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/network/macvlan/)).

The `docker-compose` file uses an environment file `.env`, that defines the `WEBPASSWORD` environment variable :

```
WEBPASSWORD=secret
```

## Setting up the router

I changed the DNS settings on my router to use `192.168.0.210`, as set in the [`docker-compose` configuration](docker-compose.yml#L21).

## Setting up the host

At this point, all your devices connected to the router should get ad-free name resolution !

All your devices, except the host itself (ie your Raspberry Pi)... To resolve this issue, we will need to create a second `macvlan` network to enable connections between the host and the Pihole container.

Following [Ivan Smirnov's insight](https://blog.ivansmirnov.name/set-up-pihole-using-docker-macvlan-network/), I created a `/usr/local/bin/pi-vlan.sh` script that runs at every reboot, and makes sure the network is correctly setup.

The script :

```shell
#!/usr/bin/env bash
ip link set eth0 promisc on
ip link add macvlan-shim link eth0 type macvlan mode bridge
ip addr add 192.168.0.42/28 dev macvlan-shim
ip link set macvlan-shim up
ip route add 192.168.0.210 dev macvlan-shim
```

This configuration "just works" with my setup. To be honest, this is black magic to me. Two notes :
1. `192.168.0.42` is the reserved address of the Raspberry Pi on my local network.
2. `192.168.0.210` is the address I attributed to the Pihole DNS container.

You will need to create the script and make it executable :

```shell
sudo nano /usr/local/bin/pi-vlan.sh
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pi-vlan.sh
```

Then configure a service :

```shell
# Add the file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/pi-vlan.service

# Register it
sudo systemctl enable pi-vlan
```

With the following content :

```
[Unit]
After=network.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/pi-vlan.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```
