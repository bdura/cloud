This page is written in the from of a "note to self" on Python libraries of interest,
development best practices, and tips and tricks in general on one way to go about
doing Python development.

If you're just starting with development, you should visit the [Environment](environment/index.md) page,
where I try to give a few tips on how to create a good coding environment.

There's some material to:

- learn Git;
- get a descent IDE (Integrated Development Environment);
- install a proper shell.
