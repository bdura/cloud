# Overview

This section deals with a few tips, tricks, and ideas about how to go about writing great code.

The "awesome" section can be understood as a reading list of interesting packages for Python in general.

## Getting started

Do **not** install Anaconda. Use miniconda instead: it installes the `conda` executable without all the malwares
that ship with the full Anaconda suite. Besides, who needs such an ugly package installer?

Installing miniconda is straightforward, just go to the [dedicated page](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
