# Using and configuring Git

!!! warning "Skip if you're familiar"

    This is rather basic stuff. If you know all about Git and SSH keys, you should **definitely** skip this section.

## Git Primer

If you're absolutely new to Git, find a tutorial and come back to this page.
[This](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) might be a good way to start (I haven't done it myself).

## Using an SSH key

!!! note "Security concerns"

    You should use SSH keys whenever possible, to avoid compromising your password.
    If your SSH key is compromised, you can invalidate it and create a new one.
