# Using and configuring Git

!!! note "Skip if you're familiar"

    This is rather basic stuff. If you know all about Git and SSH keys, you should **definitely** skip this section.

Git is an ubiquitous versioning tool that was created by Linus Tovalds, the creator of the Linux operating system.
With git, you can version your code, meaning that you can take "pictures" of your code and modify it incrementally.
Git is also design to help you collaborate.

If this is too abstract, which it probably is, read the Primer below.

## Git Primer

If you're absolutely new to Git, find a tutorial and come back to this page.
[This](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) might be a good way to start (I haven't done it myself).

## Using an SSH key

!!! warning "Security concerns"

    You should use SSH keys whenever possible, to avoid compromising your password.
    If your SSH key is compromised, you can invalidate it and create a new one.
