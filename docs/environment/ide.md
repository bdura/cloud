# Integrated Development Environment

A good Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is important. I've used two: PyCharm and VS Code, both great options.

I would advise to use VS Code. It is lightweight, fast, ships with a load of incredible goodies and has an extension for about everything.

Make sure to activate auto-formatting and auto-saving.
