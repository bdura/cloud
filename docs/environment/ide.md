# Integrated Development Environment

A good Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is important. I've used two: PyCharm and VS Code, both great options.

I would advise to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is lightweight, fast, ships with a load of incredible goodies and has an extension for about everything.

Make sure to activate auto-formatting and auto-saving.

A few extensions that will help you code faster than ever:

- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) and [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python): a language server for Python
