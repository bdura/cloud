# Integrated Development Environment

A good Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is important. I've used two: PyCharm and VS Code, both great options.

I would advise to use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). It is lightweight, fast, ships with a load of incredible goodies and has an extension for about everything.

Make sure to activate auto-saving. Go to `Settings` and search for `auto save` and select `afterDelay`.

## Extensions

!!! note "Installing extensions"

    To install an extension in VS Code, just go to to the extensions panel (should be the last button on the left of your VS Code window),
    search for an extension, and click "Install". See the [official instructions](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace).

A few extensions that will help you code faster than ever:
